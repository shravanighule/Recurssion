What is a Recursion?
Recursion in C++ is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
This approach is often used for problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems.
A recursive function typically has two main components:
Base Case: A condition under which the function will stop calling itself, preventing infinite recursion.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments to gradually approach the base case.
For example:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int fact(int n)
{
    if (n<=1)
        return 1;

    else return (n*fact(n-1));
}
int main()
{
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter an integer: "<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Factorial is: "<<fact(a);
}
Algorithms
Start
Input an integer a
Function Definition (fact(n)):
If n <= 1, return 1 (base case)
Else, return n * fact(n - 1) (recursive case)
Call the function fact(a) to calculate the factorial of the number:
If a is 0 or 1, factorial is 1.
Otherwise, multiply a with the factorial of a - 1 and keep repeating this process until a becomes 1 (recursive breakdown).
Output the result of the factorial.
End
Example walkthrough for fact(5):
fact(5) → returns 5 * fact(4)
fact(4) → returns 4 * fact(3)
fact(3) → returns 3 * fact(2)
fact(2) → returns 2 * fact(1)
fact(1) → returns 1
Final result: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
